# Project 2 — Reproducibility in Natural Language Processing  

Welcome to our project site!  
This website documents our full workflow for reproducible Natural Language Processing.

We use the **State of the Union (SOTU)** corpus to explore how computational methods reveal structure and themes in political speeches across U.S. history.
This project is divided into four parts, each with its own notebook.


You can run our analysis directly in your browser without installing anything:
